# üìò Overview

The Flex Living Reviews Dashboard is a full-stack web application that helps property managers monitor and manage guest feedback across listings.

It integrates with (mocked) Hostaway Reviews API, normalizes data, and provides a modern Manager Dashboard to filter, analyze, and approve reviews for public display.

# Manager Dashboard Features
Modern UI built with Tailwind + shadcn/ui

Filters Panel to search by property, rating, category, or source

Interactive Reviews Table with:

Inline status update (Approve / Reject)

Real-time toast feedback

Analytics Section (optional) showing performance insights

Property Review Display page ‚Äî only approved reviews appear

# üß† Design & Logic Decisions
Mock Data Strategy:
Used JSON-based fallback (mock_reviews.json) to simulate Hostaway‚Äôs sandbox response.
Ensures consistent testing without live API dependency.

Normalization Layer:
Created a dedicated normalizer (hostaway.py) to unify review fields (rating, category, timestamps) across all sources.

Status Persistence:
Approved/Rejected reviews stored in approved_reviews.json for persistence; easily replaceable with SQLite.

Frontend Hooks:
useReviews(filters) automatically constructs API URLs, unwraps wrapper responses, and revalidates on update.

UX Considerations:
Designed dashboard to feel ‚Äúmanager-first‚Äù: intuitive filters, clean table view, and non-blocking feedback toasts.
